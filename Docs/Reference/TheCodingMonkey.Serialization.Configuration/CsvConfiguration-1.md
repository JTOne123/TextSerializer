Fluent Configuration class for the [`CsvSerializer`](../TheCodingMonkey.Serialization/CsvSerializer-1.md) class.

```csharp
public class CsvConfiguration<TTargetType> : RecordConfiguration<TTargetType>
    where TTargetType : new()
```

## Public Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| [AlwaysWriteQualifier](CsvConfiguration-1/AlwaysWriteQualifier.md)(…) | True if should wrap every field in the [`Qualifier`](CsvConfiguration-1/Qualifier.md) during serialization. If false, then the qualifier is only written if the field contains the [`Delimiter`](CsvConfiguration-1/Delimiter.md). |
| [ByConvention](CsvConfiguration-1/ByConvention.md)() | Automatically configures serializer based on the class definition. All properties and fields are added as serializable in the order they appear in the class. |
| [Delimiter](CsvConfiguration-1/Delimiter.md)(…) | Character which is used to delimit fields in the record. |
| [ForMember](CsvConfiguration-1/ForMember.md)(…) | Sets the serialization properties of a member of the class. If ByConvention was called first, this will override those inferred settings. |
| [Ignore](CsvConfiguration-1/Ignore.md)(…) | Marks a field as not serializable. |
| [Qualifier](CsvConfiguration-1/Qualifier.md)(…) | Character used to wrap a field if the field contins the [`Delimiter`](CsvConfiguration-1/Delimiter.md). |
