# CsvConfiguration&lt;TTargetType&gt;.ByConvention method

Automatically configures serializer based on the class definition. All properties and fields are added as serializable in the order they appear in the class.

```csharp
public CsvConfiguration ByConvention()
```

## Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| [TextSerializationConfigurationException](../TextSerializationConfigurationException.md) | ByConvention fails if a class or structure contains a mix of Properties and Fields. Because of the limitations of the .NET Reflection API, the order cannot be properly determined at runtime if both appear in the same class. |
